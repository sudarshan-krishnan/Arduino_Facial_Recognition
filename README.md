## Face Detection Arduino Fan
### For the Dean's Ambassador Program

This Arduino project is designed to turn on a fan only when humans are recognized, saving electricity and showcasing innovative technology to high schools.

### Features
- **Face Detection:** Utilizes a camera module and face recognition algorithm to detect human presence.
- **Energy Efficiency:** The fan remains off until a human is detected, reducing unnecessary power consumption.
- **Educational Tool:** Demonstrates the application of Arduino and face recognition technology in real-world scenarios.

### Components
- Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
- Camera module (e.g., OV7670)
- Servo motor (for fan control)
- Fan
- Other necessary wires and components

### How It Works
1. The camera module continuously captures images and checks for human faces.
2. When a face is detected, the Arduino sends a signal to the servo motor to turn on the fan.
3. The fan remains on as long as a human face is present in the camera's field of view.
4. Once no face is detected for a certain period, the fan is turned off to save energy.

### Applications
- Energy-efficient cooling systems in homes, offices, and schools.
- Interactive exhibits for educational purposes.
- Automation in smart buildings and IoT devices.

### Future Enhancements
- Integration with smart home systems for seamless control.
- Improvements in face recognition accuracy and speed.
- Expansion to other appliances for energy-efficient automation.
